                             <p class="excert">
                                 Generally, what happens in a school life is we go to school because we fear of the
                                 teachers and parents but we do not know why do we have to study and go to school;
                                 similarly, we do not know the importance and application of education in life at that
                                 stage. But after the completion of grade 10, scenario completely changes, as we have to
                                 think of our future, interest and take decision wisely regarding what to study. Things
                                 even get tougher when you pass grade 12
                                 (10+2) because you are running out of time to set up the foundation for your ideal
                                 career. After10+2, Bachelor's degree or Master's degree, you may have interests for
                                 further studies abroad; so, you opt to join an educational
                                 consultancy for further preparation, as abroad study may require a standard English
                                 language test certificate such as IELTS, PTE or TOEFL, and sometimes other specialized
                                 or standardized tests like SAT, GMAT or GRE.
                                 Moreover, a standard English language test certificate either IELTS, TOEFL or PTE is
                                 sufficient, along with your academic certificate for the application. Amongst all the
                                 standard English tests, IELTS is the most popular
                                 one in Nepal. However, on the other hand, almost half of the students who try for
                                 abroad assume that IELTS is very difficult. So, in this essay, I will be addressing one
                                 particular aspect that is setting up a career
                                 goal before jumping into IELTS preparation, which help you to ace IELTS confidently.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                                 Well, I have an interesting experience over here that I would feel more relevant to
                                 share with you. When students come to visit me for counseling and preparing IELTS, I
                                 often ask them about their future plan. Almost half of the students give me a kind
                                 of worrying answer which I don’t know, let me first pass the IELTS then I will decide.
                                 In this case, you have already emphasized that IELTS is bigger than your goal and you
                                 have already made clear that IELTS is harder
                                 for you. In real world, your goal is way bigger than IELTS, and we should understand
                                 that IELTS is just a test that tests your English level. When students give such
                                 answer, it is likely that they are afraid of facing
                                 IELTS or they may have thought that IELTS is indeed very difficult. I accept that to
                                 get a high band score in IELTS is not easy but to get an acceptable score in a range of
                                 6 to 7 is not difficult either. If you have
                                 already spent more than 12 years in schools, then getting that range of IELTS score
                                 shouldn’t be tough. But we afraid a lot, we do not have a career goal and we do not
                                 have motivation, so the ultimate result is that
                                 we cannot get the desired grade in IELTS.
                             </p>

                                     To be successful in IELTS exam, we should be psychologically in a very strong
                                     state. Your motivation and determination are very important to strengthen your
                                     psychology. Furthermore, making a career goal in advance will boost your
                                     determination to achieve
                                     success in IELTS. Here, I give you an example, well, if your career goal is to be a
                                     lawyer in life, then you know you have to join a good law school and work hard.

                                 Therefore, having a career goal in life helps you to be organized, motivated and
                                 determined, which are the important psychological aspects that put you in a position of
                                 doing better in IELTS.
