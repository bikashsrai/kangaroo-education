                        <h4>Why Study in Australia</h4>
                        <p>Australian universities offer over 10,000 courses, including professional degrees, double
                            degrees and postgraduate programmers. The most sought after programmers are engineering:
                            mechanical and electrical, management and commerce,
                            natural and physical sciences, accounting and information and technology. Australia is
                            rapidly gaining a reputation as being one of the most popular destinations for international
                            students. </p>

                        <h4>Education System in Australia</h4>
                        <p>
                            Australian universities are known for their excellence in teaching and research. They offer
                            internationally recognized qualifications and study pathway opportunities for students. The
                            education system is geared towards not only accepting but welcoming
                            international students. There is a litany of universities that are considered top-tier on
                            any scale of comparison. The accreditation received from Australian universities are touted
                            all over the world, Nepal included. Australia
                            is also a top participant of the ESOS Act (Education Services for Overseas Students) which
                            safeguards the right of international students to pursue any degree they want. Being an
                            international student, it is of the utmost
                            priority for me that my desire to study is not compromised and Australia believes in
                            strongly upholding the ESOS act and going above and beyond in case the act is not upheld.
                            Furthermore, the TPS (Tuition Protection Service)
                            provides placement and refund for students as a means to contingent the failure of an
                            institution to teach the relevant course. The OSHC (Overseas Australian Health Cover)
                            provides international students with medical insurance
                            for doctor visit, minor treatments, ambulance and limited pharmaceuticals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides the various acts and laws to safeguard students’ rights to study and do so without
                            having to worry about health and placement, Australia is also one of the most open-minded
                            communities in the world. People of all race, ethnicities, and cultures
                            are welcome and celebrated precisely for that reason. I believe that I can not only be
                            included, but can thrive thanks to the policies and the people who invite such change.

                        <h4>How much will it cost?</h4>
                        <p>Australia is a country, which provides value for money by offering shorter and more intensive
                            courses. In comparison to other study abroad destinations, Australia is more affordable
                            without compromising on the quality of education.
